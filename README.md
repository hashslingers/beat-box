## Architecture

BEAT-BOX is intentionally simple and self-contained:
- **Single-file architecture**: No build process or external dependencies
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks required
- **Web Audio API**: All sounds synthesized in real-time (no audio samples)
- **Mobile-first**: Optimized for touch interfaces with 44x44px minimum touch targets
- **GitHub Pages**: Auto-deploys from `main` branch

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers supporting Web Audio API:
- Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari (iOS requires user interaction before audio playback)
- Edge

**Note**: Safari/iOS requires user interaction (tap/click) before AudioContext can be started due to autoplay policies.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! This project values simplicity and self-contained architecture. When contributing:
- Keep everything in the single HTML file
- Test on multiple browsers and mobile devices
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44px
- Maintain the minimalist aesthetic
